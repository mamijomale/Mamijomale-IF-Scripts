Additionnal scripts for the game Ion Fury

These scripts are designed to mod the game Ion Fury by adding some new special sprites for map editing, and eventual new content.
The scripts contained in the scripts folder are vanillia files, only the lines to include my scripts are necessary.

If more should be added inside, a comment will mention it in the custom files, since the vanillia files can be updated at any moment, 
risking to erase the progress or add futile extra work.
